# What is minning ??
- Minning of bitcoins, for example, basically means that finding a block that can be attached to our chain of blocks. The person who this job is called as a <b>miner</b>.
- It is a very difficult job because we know that the data in block-chain needs to be immutable and must follow Alvanche effect.
- In the end when a block is mined and approved successfully, miner is rewarded with a very high reward in terms of cryptocurrency.
## How is minning done???
- So basically, miner is provided with a block that has to be mined.
- Now, we all know that a block contains information like header, data and hash of previous block.
- However, blocks contain something else known as <b>Nonce</b>. It is nothing but just a number which is used to achieve <b>target hash</b>.Target hash is basically a hash set by Network protocols. 
- That is all a nminer has to do, find the nonce!!!.
- Miners may work in groups to find the nonce.
- A new kind of circuit known as ASIC is used by miners to do the minning which is very expenses.
## Challenges
- Since we know that a simple change in data can completely change hash of the block, sothere are only few numbers which can reach the target hash.
- It is more difficult than it looks. It take months or years to mine a block and nodes have to be kept running for this much time which demands alot of electricity and AC's to cool down the temperature of CPU.
- Moreover, target hash changes every 2 weeks, so it is kind of challenging to find the target hash on such a short notice.
